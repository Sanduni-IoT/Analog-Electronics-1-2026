Voltage Rating: The 1N4007 is rated for 1000V, which provides a huge safety margin for a 12V system.

Current Rating: It supports up to 1A, which is sufficient for simple input protection of most small DC devices.

Cost/Availability: It is one of the most common and cheapest diodes available globally, making it a practical choice for mass-produced electronics.

Performance: The simulation shows a standard forward voltage drop, delivering roughly 11.3V to the device, which is within the safe operating range for most 12V electronics.
