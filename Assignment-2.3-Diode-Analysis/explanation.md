Datasheet Analysis & Explanation

1. Forward Voltage 
2. Value:1.0V (at 10mA)
Explanation:While we often use 0.7V as a "rule of thumb" for silicon, the datasheet shows that as current increases to 10mA, the voltage drop across the 1N4148 increases to 1.0V due to internal resistance.

2. Maximum Reverse Voltage 
Value:100V
Explanation:This is the "Breaking Point." If the circuit applies more than 100V while the diode is in reverse bias, the diode will fail and start conducting electricity backwards, likely destroying it.

3. Maximum Forward Current
Value:300mA
Explanation:This is the safe limit for continuous current. If the circuit draws more than 300mA through this diode, it will overheat.

4. Operating Temperature Range
Value:-65°C to +175°C
Explanation:This diode is very durable. It can operate in extreme cold and extreme heat, making it suitable for industrial and automotive environments.
