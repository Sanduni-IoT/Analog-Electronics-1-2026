Assignment 2.2 – Diode I–V Curve Using DC Sweep

Sanduni Edirisinghe

Simulation Details
Sweep Range:0V to 1V
Step Size:0.01V
Components:Voltage source (V1), Resistor (1kΩ), and a standard Diode (D1).

Results
The simulation plot shows the I-V characteristic of the diode, illustrating that current remains near zero until the forward voltage reaches approximately 0.7V, at which point it increases exponentially.
